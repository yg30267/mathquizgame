# Galactic Ground Zero

A sciâ€‘fi battle royale prototype inspired by tactical PUBG-style gameplay with polished, grounded visuals. Includes three distinct maps: Desert, Underwater, and Wild Forest. Features hitscan gunplay, throwable grenades with area damage, basic targets, and a minimal HUD.

## Plot
In a fractured future, off-world megacorps abduct combatants through quantum rifts to a remote proving ground. Teams fight for extraction keys while an adaptive AI harvests combat data to manufacture the perfect soldier. Only one team returns; the rest become blueprints.
